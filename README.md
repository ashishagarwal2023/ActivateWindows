# WindowsActivator
A simple Windows Activator I coded. It uses a trick from a online website to activate Microsoft Windows for free without a license.

# How it works
As an example, let's take the Home.py. It does some commands provided on the web that helps you to activate Windows for free.

# Does it still work?
Yes, it should work. Make sure you are running Windows 7 or higher with Python installed. I'm looking further to continue this application now as it has been dead for a long while.

# Legal
I do not promote free activation or cracking anything. This project is just for educational purposes, and I am not responsible for any cases.
